# Rules

## Branch Rules

- `main` is a protected branch which requires 1 member's approval for pull requests.
- `dev` is the "main" branch for develops, all branches should branch from this branch.

- Use prefix `topic-` for developing specific features or functions.
- Use prefix `bugfix-` for branches that fix bugs.
- Keep names stupidly simple, easy to understand.

## File Rules

- `docs/` is where all documents except README goes.
- `agents/` is where our works go.

## Documentation Rules

- All notes and ideas first go on our HackMD note or on Discord.
